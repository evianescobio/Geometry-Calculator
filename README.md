# 📐 Geometry Calculator (Python)

This Python program lets you calculate the area, perimeter and volume of common geometric shapes using a simple text-based menu. It demonstrates the use of functions, loops, conditionals, and user input.

## 🔹 Features

1- Area (Triangle, Rectangle, Square, Circle, Trapezoid)

2- Perimeter (Triangle, Rectangle, Square, Circle, Trapezoid)

3- Volume (Rectangular Prism, Cube, Cylinder)


## ⚙️ How It Works

When you run the program, it displays a menu with shape options (triangle, rectangle, square, circle, trapezoid).
Each shape has its own formula defined in a separate function.


## 💡 Future Improvements

- Support for units (e.g., cm², m²)
- GUI version using Tkinter or a web-based interface
